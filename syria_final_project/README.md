## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to display and understand two aspects:

- Which Syrian Governorates were grouping more IDPs during the conflict.
- Which countries are the ones who received more Syrian refugees based on gender and group ages.
- Which countries sought asylum or applied for during those years.

For a deeper understanding of the events, please see this report.

## IDP based on Syrian Governorates

This first part is focused on displaying the number of IDPs located in each of the fourteen Governorates that form the Syrian Arab Republic during the (available) years between 2011 and 2021.

At the first stages of the conflict, much of the IDPs were located in the central regions of the country. The number was low until the end of 2013 when Daesh (the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) occupied the eastern-central regions (along the Euphrates river) and established al Raqqa as its capital for four years (2013-2017) when Western-backed rebel forces defeated ISIL forces. For that reason, the population who could flee from the reign of terror installed by the radicals moved to the west and NW of the country. It is also remarkable that there was an important amount of IDP in rural Damascus due to its capital's proximity.

As the conflict went by, the IDP's exodus was located increasingly in the NW regions, especially Aleppo and Idleb. However, the Aleppo Governorate suffered important damage when Russia entered in October 2015 to back the government forces as a crucial turning point for the path of defeating the rebel factions (also against ISIL).

After that, Government forces were gaining territory towards the north and east until reaching the Euphrates river (the north side has been controlled by Kurdish forces after defeating ISIL since 2017).

However, the Idleb region has been resisting and continues to remain the main rebel stronghold. Therefore, it has become the main location for the majority of displaced people who still refuse to follow authoritarian rules, fear repression after returning to their home or have lost everything back home.

For almost a decade, Syria is the country with the most number of IDPs (Internal Displaced People) followed by the Democratic Republic of the Congo (5.3 millions) and Colombia (4.9 millions).

## Refugee dispersion demographics based on gender and group ages

The second part is focused on displaying the top countries that gather the majority of refugees based on gender and group ages from 2011 to 2021.

As the years went by, there was a change of dynamics when the Civil War started (from European to closer Arab countries) except for Germany and Turkey (not considered an Arab country). Therefore, not only the proximity but cultural and religious roots seem quite strong when determining which country to head.

It is also important to remark that, in front of the increase of the refugee turnout at the gates of the European countries, the European Union had to elaborate a plan to solve that dramatic and complex situation. That is why they would distribute that population between the member States. However, some of them (especially from the eastern part) were reluctant to those policies, given that their governments were implementing anti-immigration measures.

About 

In summary, Turkey, by far, is the country that encompass a more amount of refugees.
