## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to display and understand two aspects:

- Which Syrian Governorates were grouping more IDPs during the conflict.
- Which countries are the ones who received more Syrian refugees or sought asylum during those years.

## Context (Arab Spring)

During 2010 and 2011, in several countries of the Arab World, there was a rising in dissatisfaction and the need for change in those countries tired of decades of authoritarianism, corruption, poverty and unemployment, among other factors. Therefore, the population started to march on the streets, demanding human rights, justice, employment and Regime changes.

At the start of that period, the majority of the protests were peaceful and achieved their goals by overthrowing the regimes in some of those countries, such as Tunisia (posterior free elections); in other places, they achieved governmental changes such as Jordan or Oman among others. However, the regimes in Lybia and Yemen were overthrown, but the protests escalated to violent conflicts causing the clash inside their borders until nowadays. 

The case of Syria is similar to the later ones, although the regime was never deposed. Therefore, the situation changed and the peaceful protests turned violent because of the violent response from the al-Assad regime. That is when the Civil War began.
