## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to display and understand two aspects:

- Which Syrian Governorates were grouping more IDPs during the conflict.
- Which countries are the ones who received more Syrian refugees based on gender and group ages.
- Which countries sought asylum or applied for during those years.

For a deeper understanding of the events, please see this report.

## IDP based on Syrian Governorates

This first part is focused on displaying the number of IDPs located in each of the fourteen Governorates that form the Syrian Arab Republic during the (available) years between 2011 and 2021.

## Refugee dispersion demographics based on gender and group ages

The second part is focused on displaying the top countries that gather the majority of refugees based on gender and group ages from 2011 to 2021.

As the years went by, there was a change of dynamics when the Civil War started (from European to closer Arab countries) except for Germany and Turkey (not considered an Arab country). Therefore, not only the proximity but cultural and religious roots seem quite strong when determining which country to head.

About 

In summary, Turkey, by far, is the country that encompass a more amount of refugees.
