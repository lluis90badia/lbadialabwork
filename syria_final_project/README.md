## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to display and understand two aspects:

- Which Syrian Governorates were grouping more IDPs during the conflict.
- Which countries are the ones who received more Syrian refugees based on gender and group ages.
- Which countries sought asylum or applied for during those years.

For a deeper understanding of the events, please see this report.

## IDP based on Syrian Governorates

This first part is focused on displaying the number of IDPs located in each of the fourteen Governorates that form the Syrian Arab Republic during the (available) years between 2011 and 2021.

## Refugee dispersion demographics based on gender and group ages

The second part is focused on displaying the top countries that gather the majority of refugees based on gender and group ages from 2011 to 2021.

Regarding the refugee distribution based on group ages and gender, there is a clear difference between 2011 (data before the events started or the very early stages) and the following years.

The first one, the majority of the people were families with small children (0-4 years), and the countries that were heading were from the West. Therefore, it seems that they were looking for stability and a more level of future opportunities.

However, after the early stages, the distribution got more uniform between the groups, although the adult one has been the top one. Regarding the countries in which they ended up, there was a clear change of tendency of western countries to closer countries with similar cultural and religious roots.

About the differences between gender, in general, the male population has been greater than the female. There are no major divergences between them, except that there is more presence of male refugees in Germany than in the female population, which reflects that it was more difficult for them to reach greater objectives for better prospects.

In summary, Turkey, by far, is the country that encompass a more amount of refugees.
