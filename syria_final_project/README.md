## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to display and understand two aspects:

- Which Syrian Governorates were grouping more IDPs during the conflict.
- Which countries are the ones who received more Syrian refugees based on gender and group ages.
- Which countries sought asylum or applied for during those years.

For a deeper understanding of the events, please see this attached [report]().

## IDP based on Syrian Governorates

This first part is focused on displaying the number of IDPs located in each of the fourteen Governorates that form the Syrian Arab Republic during the (available) years between 2011 and 2021.

## Refugee dispersion demographics based on gender and group ages

The second part is focused on displaying the top countries that gather the majority of refugees based on gender and group ages from 2011 to 2021.

Regarding the refugee distribution based on group ages and gender, there is a clear difference between 2011 (data before the events started or the very early stages) and the following years.

The first one, the majority of the people were families with small children (0-4 years), and the countries that were heading were from the West. Therefore, it seems that they were looking for stability and a more level of future opportunities.

However, after the early stages, the distribution got more uniform between the groups, although the adult one has been the top one. Regarding the countries in which they ended up, there was a clear change of tendency of western countries to closer countries with similar cultural and religious roots.

About the differences between gender, in general, the male population has been greater than the female. There are no major divergences between them, except that there is more presence of male refugees in Germany than in the female population, which reflects that it was more difficult for them to reach greater objectives for better prospects.

## Top Asylum-Seeker/Applicant countries

First of all, it is important to understand the difference between a refugee and an asylum-seeker/applicant:

- A refugee is a person who is fleeing armed conflicts or persecution and its situation is perilous that cross national borders to seek safety and access to assistance from another country. 

- Whereas an Asylum-Seeker is a person who claims to be a refugee but its application has not been evaluated yet. Until that person will not become a refugee, will be recognised as an Asylum-Seeker.

- On the other hand, the term Asylum-Applicant differs from Asylum-Seeker when the application has been already submitted. Therefore, the UNHCR distinguish the ones who are in process (Seeker) and the ones who have already a response (Applicant).

According to the UNHCR data, there are clear differences between the countries where the Syrian population wanted to apply (that does not mean they got accepted as a refugee) or were seeking asylum and the ones who ended up in closer countries as refugees.

Besides, there is a contrast between the Asylum-Seekers and the Asylum-Applicants. About the first ones, not only were seeking in European countries but countries such as the USA or Libya; whereas the latter ones were choosing mostly European countries which are members of the European Union.

## Conclusions

- Most of the data is based on estimations giving the difficulty to obtain reliable ground sources from a country which have been struggling for more than a decade without hopes of an imminent peace deal or an agreement to lay down arms between the contenders with opposing points of view.

- For almost a decade, Syria is the country with the most number of IDPs (Internal Displaced People) followed by the Democratic Republic of the Congo (5.3 million) and Colombia (4.9 million).

- As the conflict progressed, the population fleeing the war has been concentrating in the areas of the northwest not controlled by the Syrian government (SDF - Syrian Democratic Forces and the Kurdish left-wing party PYD in the north).

- Turkey is, by far, the country with more Syrian refugee population; whereas Germany is, by far, the state with more asylum applications for a better future for them and their families.
